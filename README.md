# NetGuardian

NetGuardian is an AI-orchestrated security system that monitors network activity, neutralizes threats, and generates reports through six specialized layers.

## Project Overview

NetGuardian provides comprehensive network security through a multi-layered architecture:

1. **Sensor Layer**: Collects data from network traffic, endpoints, logs, and threat intelligence feeds
2. **Processing Layer**: Analyzes collected data to detect anomalies, threats, and attack patterns
3. **Response Layer**: Automates security responses and incident handling
4. **Data Layer**: Stores security events, intelligence, and evidence
5. **Presentation Layer**: Provides dashboards, reports, and alerts for security monitoring
6. **AI Layer**: Orchestrates security operations with advanced machine learning and NLP capabilities
